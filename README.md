# elevator-java
An attempt to design a good elevator system in Java. 

Run ElevatorSimulator.java and type the floors you want to request on the console.


Pending Items:
- Method to manually set an elevator in maintenance and back to ready
- What if a person is riding an elevator and presses a floor button from inside the elevator (then the current elevator has to go there and not go through algorithm)
- Add file input 
- Refactor code, write test class and add comments 
- Verify thread interaction thoroughly (Saw some gaps)
- Elevator needs to wait for door open close events in case of multiple requests (needs debugging)
